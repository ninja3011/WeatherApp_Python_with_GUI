# WeatherApp_Python_with_GUI

# The app aims at returning current weather conditions for the city entered by the user
# In case of invalid input the application informs the user and maintains its running state. i.e. doesnot crash. User Friendly Application
# The project is a basic gui project using tkinter Lib in conjunction with the Image and ImagePk from PIL Lib
# This project has been recreated observing Keith Galli with majority elements being similar. However, it possesses a lot more documentation than provided by Keith.

## I hope you can take up this project as well as a learning experience. Feel free to use my code and directeries to help you move forward.

# Important Note:
The API Key used by me was for my project and may have expired by the time you have come across this project
You can create a free acount on openweathermap.org with your email ID alone. That will prove sufficient for this project
